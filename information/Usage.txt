#Welcome to the Thursday Program...#

#Description - This program was made for numerous reasons. This program works on top of a bash shell.#
#This version of this program is still early and will consistently be updated. Thursday was meant for# 
#cross platform useability, so that you would not have to remember the syntax between different operating# 
#systems and shells. Like said before this program is not a dependent shell and can not function without# 
#libraries and the bash shell.#

#Future Intentions - My goal for this shell program is to create my own shell that I can implement for#
#cross platform use. I want to be able to do the same thing that I can on any system. I want to incorporate#
#new designs and ideas into this program as it continuesto grow. These are big goals to accomplish but I hope# 
#that I can do it.#

#Notes / Help - Thursday is incorporated with multiple methods to assist anyone with using this system.#
#If you need help using the commands just type help (command), and it will output the description of# 
#the command and what is needed. Below is listed all the commands that are incorporated as of right now.# 
#You will have to enter commands in all lowercase.# 

#Commands - Just type commands alone and they will all be displayed.#
