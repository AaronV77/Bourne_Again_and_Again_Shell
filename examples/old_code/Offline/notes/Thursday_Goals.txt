    Goals:
        - Have the master branch copy have no comments in the code.
        - Condense the library and make it more efficent.
        - Implement when a user types shutdown it shuts down the system. "/sbin/shutdown -h now"
        - Implement a way for standard out and standard error to be condensed.
        - Implement two separate command parsers. One for operators the other for non operators.
        - Implement a way to turn off errors across the system.
        - Have clearer and more error messages across the system.
        - Condense the tab auto complete in the main.
    

    Later thinking:
        - Save the main of thursday for other programs. Make sure that its heavily documented.
        - If we have usage > output1.txt > output.txt, this will distribute the data to both files.
        - If we have ./a.out < input1.txt < input2.txt, this will import both datasets into ./a.out.
        - Allow multiple [, {, (, be allowed within themselves.
