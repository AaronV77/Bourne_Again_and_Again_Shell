Make sure that there is "you are in (blank) method" and "you are leaving (blank) method".
Make sure that error statments are using the method name.
Make sure that pointers are being cleaned up in methods.
Make sure that methods are not changing directories inorder to read / output to a file.
Make sure that we are strduping the pointers and not just using them.
Make sure that we are commeenting on what each line is doing in the methods.



For the color feature:
	- If found we should return something special
	- Then have the argument checker return something special.


Gotta Fix or Finish

	 - Argument Checker
	 - Color 

	 - LS color
	 - Search Commands
	 

Done:
	 - Search and Help
	 - We are going to have a problem with ./run something. This will be added to our os commad file.
	
	
	void DisplayDirectories(char * searchWord, int number, int theSwitch); 
	int SearchCommands(char * envp[], vector<char*>incomingInput, int signal);
	
	void therandom::ColorChange(char * sentence, int signal);
	int ArgumentChecker(char * theCommands, char * envp[]);
	void DepthFirstSearch(char * path, char * command, int number, int theSwitch);
	void EnvironmentUtilites(int Number);

	do an export
